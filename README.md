# MedScan

⭐ **Problem Statement**

The healthcare process often becomes inefficient due to scattered medical records, slow verification of patient information by doctors, and difficulty for insurance agencies to validate claims accurately. Patients struggle to maintain organized reports, doctors lack quick access to verified data, and insurance verification becomes time-consuming and error-prone.

⭐ **Solution Arrived**

MedScan provides a unified digital platform that securely stores medical reports and enables seamless access for patients, doctors, and insurance agencies. The app offers role-based login, blockchain-backed authentication, doctor credential verification, and quick retrieval of medical data. This ensures accuracy, transparency, and faster decision-making across the healthcare workflow.

⭐ **Status of the Project**

The project is in the early development stage. The complete frontend for the multi-step login flow—including login method selection, QR/User ID screens, role selection, and password verification—has been successfully designed and implemented. The next phase will focus on connecting these frontend components with backend APIs, integrating secure authentication, and expanding the UI for dashboards and report management.
